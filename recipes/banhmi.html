    <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
    <h6>Banh Mi only do we get amazing contrasts in flavor and texture, but also the temperature difference between the crisp, warm, meat-filled roll, and cool, crunchy vegetables makes this so much fun to eat.</h6>
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>daikon radish</li>
        <li>carrots</li>
        <li>seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>mayonnaise</li>
        <li>French Bagutte</li>
        <li>cooked pork roast, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>smooth pate, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>English cucumber, diced</li>
        <li>cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>jalapeno pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>INSTRUCTION</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Toss radish and carrot with seasoned rice vinegar in a bowl until well coated. Let sit until veggies become slightly limp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and set aside or refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Split French roll just enough so you can open it like a book. Pull out some of the bread from the top half to better accommodate the filling if desired.</li>
        <li>Spread the interior surfaces of roll liberally with mayonnaise mixture. Transfer roll, cut-side up, to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until warm and crisp with slightly browned edges, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place sliced pork, paté, pickled radish and carrot, cucumber, jalapeño, and cilantro leaves in warm roll. Cut in half to serve.</li>
    </ol>
