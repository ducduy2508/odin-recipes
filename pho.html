            <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with four quarts of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for six to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>

Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, one to two minutes. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
